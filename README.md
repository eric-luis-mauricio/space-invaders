<h1 style="text-align: center">Space Invaders</h1>

I recreated Space Invaders, a popular game between 80's and 90's using Python and librays like Pygame.
I make this with the help of the FreeCodeCamp channel in Youtube.

	
<h2>How play?</h2>
You can play this downloading in a file .ZIP, after play normally, <b>as long as you have python downloaded on your machine</b> otherwise, download from the official Python website
You can use left and right arrows for move the ship; <br />

You can use ESC or P for pause the game, tighten again for unpause game. <br />
