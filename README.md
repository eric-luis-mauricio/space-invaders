<p>I recreated Space Invaders, a popular game between 80's and 90's using Python and librays like Pygame.</p>
<p>I make this with the help of the FreeCodeCamp channel in Youtube.</p>
<p>You can play this downloading in a file .ZIP, after play normally, <b>as long as you have python downloaded on your machine</b> otherwise, download from the official Python website</p>
<p>Thanks for read!</p>
